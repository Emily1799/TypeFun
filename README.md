# TypeFun
An incremental game that helps kids learn to type! Visit http://http://www.typefunkids.com/ to view live.

## Inspiration
I'm going to teach a little girl (about 6 years old) how to program, but she doesn't know how to type! For now, we're working with Scratch, but since she'll eventually need typing skills to learn a real programming language, I went looking for a good game to set her up with. I couldn't find any game that looked engaging and fun.

## About TypeFun's mechanics
This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to build and alter a webpage. All code is client side.

## The hard part
Figuring out how HTML worked in the beginning. This was my first time doing anything even resembling web development -- I knew a little bit of JavaScript and HTML, but that's it. I had a new Google search open every 5 minutes for the first few hours until I got most the HTML done. Understanding enough CSS to use the boilerplate stylesheet that I found, getting everything to work together across files.

## My favorite parts of this
* It can actually be considered a "complete" project. No extremely necessary features missing!
* It can actually be fun to play

## What I've learned while making this
* How to use CSS, HTML and  Javascript to create a dynamic website.
* Setting up a custom domain pointing to a Github pages website.
* Improved my HTML skills.
* How cookies work, and how to use them to make a save file
* Lots of thoughts on good coding practices to avoid "legacy code" making new ideas difficult to implement.

## Things to do if I want to come back here
Adding achievements, balancing game play a little better, prettifying the page more, maybe custom wordlists, maybe a prestige mechanic... There's lots I can do!
